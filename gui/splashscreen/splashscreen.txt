[font="sans-bold-20"]  Thank you for installing 0 A.D. Empires Ascendant!

[imgleft="constructionIcon"]This game is still in development. Features are missing and it contains bugs.

[imgleft="iconLag"]The game can have performance problems, especially with large maps and a great number of units.

[imgleft="iconMap"]The civilizations of 0 A.D are deactivated/Deleted, which makes the scenario maps useless in this mod. This does not happen with skirmish and random maps.

[imgleft="iconFormation"]Formations are a work in progress, but you can toggle forming and disbanding formations as desired.
